<p> NYC Parks Crime Statistics show that the grand larceny crimes, thefts of property valued over $1,000 without threat of force, are mostly recurrent in Lower Manhattan while higher numbers of cases have been marked in Harlem and the Upper West Side. </p>

<br>

<p> NYCity News Service analyzed the percent change of grand larceny data from 2015 and 2022. The following parks had the most drastic increase in crime numbers: Marcus Garvey Park (5900%), Washington Square Park (960%), Randall’s Island Park (280%), Tompkins Square Park (233%), and Booker T. Washington Playground (200%). </p>

<br>

<p> “[Grand larceny is] a high volume crime.” said Christopher Herrmann, an Assistant Professor at CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice. There have been 192 grand larcenies in Manhattan’s parks up until September 30 of this year, according to the NYPD data. </p>

<br>

<p> The findings show that some clusters of problematic parks are located in the Lower East Side and East Harlem. The crime analysis and mapping expert explained that “when you're studying crime in the parks, you're really studying crime around the parks, the perimeter of the parks.” He added, “The issue is [if] the park is really just a representation of the high crime neighborhood or vice versa.” </p>

<br>

<p> Park crimes tend to occur in specific parts of the green space such as poorly light areas or those that have easy access to a subway station, so the perpetrator can get away without complications. As for park safety, after this type of criminal act happens, the police usually react by increasing patrol and making necessary arrests. “A lot of times it's just a follow up with the community and reminding them that they need to, you know, again, if they see something, say something… There's not much else they can do,” said Herrmann.</p>
